SOLID is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design principles by Robert C. Martin . These principles establish practices that lend to developing software with considerations for maintaining and extending as the project grows. 
 
Single-responsibility Principle states 
 
Next, create the AreaCalculator class and then write up the logic to sum up the areas of all provided shapes. The area of a square is calculated by length squared. The area of a circle is calculated by pi times radius squared. To use the AreaCalculator class, you will need to instantiate the class and pass in an array of shapes and display the output at the bottom of the page. 
 
Here is an example with a collection of three shapes 
 
The problem with the output method is that the AreaCalculator handles the logic to output the data. This would violate the single-responsibility principle. The AreaCalculator class should only be concerned with the sum of the areas of provided shapes. 
 
The SumCalculatorOutputter class would work like this 
 
That satisfies the single-responsibility principle. 
 
Let’s revisit the AreaCalculator class and focus on the sum method 
 
That would violate the open-closed principle. A way you can make this sum method better is to remove the logic to calculate the area of each shape out of the AreaCalculator class method and attach it to each shape’s class. 
 
The sum method for AreaCalculator can then be rewritten as 
 
Coding to an interface is an integral part of SOLID. 
 
If you tried to run an example like this 
 
That satisfies the Liskov substitution principle. 
 
Interface segregation principle states 
 
Still building from the previous ShapeInterface example, you will need to support the new three-dimensional shapes of Cuboid and Spheroid, and these shapes will need to also calculate volume. 
 
Dependency inversion principle states 
 
This principle allows for decoupling. 
 
Here is an example of a PasswordReminder that connects to a MySQL database 
 
This snippet above violates this principle as the PasswordReminder class is being forced to depend on the MySQLConnection class. Later, if you were to change the database engine, you would also have to edit the PasswordReminder class, and this would violate the open-close principle. Also, instead of directly type-hinting MySQLConnection class in the constructor of the PasswordReminder, you instead type-hint the DBConnectionInterface and no matter the type of database your application uses, the PasswordReminder class can connect to the database without any problems and open-close principle is not violated. 

 

 

The Object-Oriented Design Principles are the core of OOP programming, but I have seen most of the Java programmers chasing design patterns like Singleton pattern, Decorator pattern, or Observer pattern, and not putting enough attention on learning Object-oriented analysis and design. I have regularly seen Java programmers and developers of various experience level, who have either never heard about these OOP and SOLID design principle, or simply doesn’t know what benefits a particular design principle offers and how to apply these design principle in coding. I have not put examples, just to keep the article short but you can find a lot of examples of these design principles on the internet and even on my Java blog, just use the search bar at the top of the page. If you are not able to understand a design principle, you should try to do more than one example because sometimes we connect to another example or author better but you must understand these design principles and learn how to use it in your code. 
 
DRY 
 
Our first object-oriented design principle is DRY, as the name suggests DRY means don’t write duplicate code, instead use Abstraction to abstract common things in one place. The benefit of this Object oriented design principle is in maintenance. You can further check out the Basics of Software Architecture & Design Patterns in Java course on Udemy to learn more about writing good code and best practices to follow while designing a system. 
 
Encapsulate What Changes 
 
The benefit of this OOP Design principle is that It’s easy to test and maintain proper encapsulated code. If you are coding in Java then follow the principle of making variable and methods private by default and increasing access step by step like from a private to protected and not public. 
 
Single Responsibility Principle 
 
Single Responsibility Principle is another SOLID design principle, and represent “S” on the SOLID acronym. The key benefit of this principle is that it reduces coupling between the individual component of the software and Code. 
 
Dependency Injection or Inversion principle 
 
The beauty of this design principle is that any class which is injected by DI framework is easy to test with the mock object and easier to maintain because object creation code is centralized in the framework and client code is not littered with that. You can further see the SOLID Principles of Object-Oriented Design and Architecture course on Udemy to learn more about this useful principle. 
 
Here is an example of the code which violates Dependency Inversion Principle or DIP in Java 
 
This problem can be solved by using the Dependency Inversion Principle where instead of AppManager asking for EventLogWriter, it will be injected or provided to AppManager by the framework. 
 
Favor Composition over Inheritance 
 
Even Joshua Bloch’s Effective Java advise favoring composition over inheritance. If you are still not convinced then you can also read here to learn more about why your Composition is better than Inheritance for reusing code and functionality. If you are interested in learning more about Object Oriented Programming Concepts like Composition, Inheritance, Association, Aggregation, etc, you can also take a look at the Object-Oriented Programming in Java course on Coursera. 
 
Liskov Substitution Principle in Java 
 
If you are interested in a more real-world example, then the SOLID Principles of Object-Oriented Design course on Pluarlsight is a good course to start with. 
 
Interface Segregation Principle 
 
Interface Segregation Principle stats that, a client should not implement an interface if it doesn’t use that. Another benefit of this design principle in Java is, the interface has the disadvantage of implementing all method before any class can use it so having single functionality means less method to implement. 
 
Programming for Interface not implementation 
 
In concrete words, you should use interface type on variables, return types of a method or argument type of methods in Java like using SuperClass type to store object rather using SubClass. 
 
Summary 
 
Once you get hold of that, the next step is to learn Design patterns in Java, which uses these design patterns to solve common problems of application development and software engineering. Find out, whether we are violating any design principle and compromising the flexibility of code, but again as nothing is perfect in this world, don’t always try to solve the problem with design patterns and design principle they are mostly for large enterprise project which has longer maintenance cycle. Looking open source code from Apache and Google are some good ways of learning Java and OOP design principles. They will show you, how design principles should be used in coding and Java programs. 

 

MVC mostly relates to the UI / interaction layer of an application. You’re still going to need business logic layer, maybe some service layer and data access layer. 
 
Design components 
 
* The Model contains only the pure application data, it contains no logic describing how to present the data to a user. * The View presents the model’s data to the user. The view knows how to access the model’s data, but it does not know what this data means or what the user can do to manipulate it. * The Controller exists between the view and the model. 
 
        this. 
 
        return model. 
 
        student. 
 
Disadvantages 
 
* Knowledge on multiple technologies becomes the norm. Developers using MVC need to be skilled in multiple technologies. This article is contributed by Saket Kumar. If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article using contribute 

 

MVC Pattern stands for Model-View-Controller Pattern. 
 
Implementation 
 
We are going to create a Student object acting as a model. StudentView will be a view class which can print student details on console and StudentController is the controller class responsible to store data in Student object and update view StudentView accordingly. MVCPatternDemo, our demo class, will use StudentController to demonstrate use of MVC pattern. StudentView 

 

Pattern Description 
 
Components within the layered architecture pattern are organized into horizontal layers, each layer performing a specific role within the application . Each layer of the layered architecture pattern has a specific role and responsibility within the application. Each layer in the architecture forms an abstraction around the work that needs to be done to satisfy a particular business request. One of the powerful features of the layered architecture pattern is the separation of concerns among components. 
 
This type of component classification makes it easy to build effective roles and responsibility models into your architecture, and also makes it easy to develop, test, govern, and maintain applications using this architecture pattern due to well-defined component interfaces and limited component scope. 
 
Key Concepts 
 
Notice in Figure 1-2 that each of the layers in the architecture is marked as being closed. This is a very important concept in the layered architecture pattern. This type of architecture then becomes very hard and expensive to change. The layers of isolation concept also means that each layer is independent of the other layers, thereby having little or no knowledge of the inner workings of other layers in the architecture. 
 
While closed layers facilitate layers of isolation and therefore help isolate change within the architecture, there are times when it makes sense for certain layers to be open.  For example, suppose you want to add a shared-services layer to an architecture containing common service components accessed by components within the business layer . This is an age-old problem with the layered architecture, and is solved by creating open layers within the architecture. Leveraging the concept of open and closed layers helps define the relationship between architecture layers and request flows and also provides designers and developers with the necessary information to understand the various layer access restrictions within the architecture. 
 
Failure to document or properly communicate which layers in the architecture are open and closed usually results in tightly coupled and brittle architectures that are very difficult to test, maintain, and deploy. 
 
Pattern Example 
 
To illustrate how the layered architecture works, consider a request from a business user to retrieve customer information for a particular individual as illustrated in Figure 1-4. This module is responsible for knowing which modules in the business layer can process that request and also how to get to that module and what data it needs . The customer object in the business layer is responsible for aggregating all of the information needed by the business request . These modules in turn execute SQL statements to retrieve the corresponding data and pass it back up to the customer object in the business layer. 
 
The customer object in the business layer can be a local Spring bean or a remote EJB3 bean. NET framework to access C# modules in the business layer, with the customer and order data access modules implemented as ADO . 
 
Pattern Analysis 
 
The following table contains a rating and analysis of the common architecture characteristics for the layered architecture pattern. 
 
Ease of deployment 
 
One small change to a component can require a redeployment of the entire application , resulting in deployments that need to be planned, scheduled, and executed during off-hours or on weekends. 
 
Testability 
 
A developer can mock a presentation component or screen to isolate testing within a business component, as well as mock the business layer to test certain screen functionality. 
 
Scalability 
 
You can scale a layered architecture by splitting the layers into separate physical deployments or replicating the entire application into multiple nodes, but overall the granularity is too broad, making it expensive to scale. 
 
Ease of development 
 
Because most companies develop applications by separating skill sets by layers , this pattern becomes a natural choice for most business-application development. " You can Google “Conway’s law" to get more information about this fascinating correlation. 

 

 

What is MVC Architecture? 
 
The architecture components of the MVC pattern are designed to handle different aspects of an application in development. The MVC design pattern serves to separate the presentation layer from the business logic. 
 
You can think of a web application as a Model View Controller design. 
 
Loosely Coupled 
 
Developers can modify one of the pieces, and the other 2 pieces should keep working and not require modifications. When designing MVC software – the logic in each of the three buckets is independent. Everything in View acts independently of the model – and vice verse, the view won’t have any logic dependent on the model. 
 
Keep learning about web apps 
 
Learn the basics of JavaScript, DOM traversal, and event handling all in one place. 
 
Controller 
 
The controller is the brains of our application - the JavaScript that handles the click event. The code for this exercise comes from the Complete JavaScript Course. 

 

However, it is often the case that we fall into the trap of designing them in a more complex way than necessary. In the years I have spent in this fantastic world of programming, I have seen some really complex codes that don’t make sense to me. In other words, I have seen code that only the programmer who writes it understands how it works. However, when one asks the programmer to explain what the code does, he or she would only say “Only God knows that”. 
 
KISS 
 
“Keep It Simple, Stupid” – The KISS programming, in particular, is really important. My advice is to follow the methodology of KISS software development and avoid using fancy features from the programming language you’re working with. This is not to say that you should not use those features, but use them only when there are perceptible benefits to the problem you’re solving. With this premise in mind, I introduce you to the next principle. 
 
YAGNI 
 
YAGNI is a principle behind the extreme programming practice of “Do the Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work”. Even when this principle is part of XP, it is applicable in all kinds of methodologies and processes of development. By implementing the ideals of “You Aren’t Gonna Need It” programming, you will save yourself time and be able to move forward with projects efficiently. 
 
DRY 
 
"The DRY principle, formulated by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas in their book The Pragmatic Programmer, states that “every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system." In other words, you must try to maintain the behavior of a functionality of the system in a single piece of code. On the other hand, when the DRY principle is not followed, this is known as WET solutions, which stands for either Write Everything Twice or We Enjoy Typing. DRY programming is very useful, especially in big applications where code is constantly maintained, changed and extended by a lot of programmers. There are a lot of other principles and good software app development tips to increase productivity and efficiency, but I believe that these three are the basics.
